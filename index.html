                            <h4>As suspense continues, BCCI readies SA visas for both Dravid and Laxman</h4>
                            <p>There has been total silence from Rahul Dravid, compounding the suspense over his continuation with the Indian team as head coach. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), though, is not staying quiet. It is carrying on with its work as if it's business as usual. Travel papers for Dravid, as well as for all the members of his support staff, have been prepared for the upcoming tour of South Africa.</p>

                            <h3>Mahmudul rues missing out on a big hundred</h3>
                            <p>Bangladesh opener Mahmudul Hasan expressed disappointment about not being able to turn a promising knock into a big score on the opening day of the Sylhet Test against New Zealand. Mahmudul scored a fine 86 but New Zealand hit back to keep the hosts to 310/9 with Glenn Phillips taking 4 for 53.

                                Incidentally, Mahmudul was also set for a hundred in his last Test, against Afghanistan, before departing for 76. "I don't get the chance to get set every day and I missed two innings [to make it big] and in the coming days will try to do better," Mahmudul told reporters after the opening day's play</p>

                            <p>Australia captain Pat Cummins is revelling in what has been a golden year for Australian cricket, even by their lofty standards. The 30-year-old has overseen a World Test Championship win, retained the Ashes in England and pulled off a World Cup win in India, all in the space of six months. Fellow fast bowler and New South Welshman Mitchell Starc was all praise for his leader.
